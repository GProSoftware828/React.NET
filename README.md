# React.NET
## React on .NET from the ground up


#### React sandbox running on a .NET server

To run it locally:

1. On a Windows PC, download the release to your desktop.
2. Rt click on the downloaded folder and chose 'Extract All'.
3. Open the extraced folder, click on the solution file to open it, ReactApp.sln
(it should open with Visual Studio automatically, if you need to take fifteen minutes to install
Visual Studio Community 2019 for free here, [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/))
4. Then in Visual Studio click the green arrow at the top for the local host to open with the program (it takes a few seconds
for the browser to boot up the first time).
5. Rt click in the browser window anywhere and chose 'Inspect Element'. In the menu that populates, chose the tab for the
'Console' which will open what looks like a text box window.
6. Input values to the forms on the webpage and have fun inspecting what comes up in the Console text box!
